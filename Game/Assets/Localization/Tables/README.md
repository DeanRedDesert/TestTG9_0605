# Localization Tables

This table contains localization tables for all supported locales in the game. Asset and string tables are separate so it is recommended that you implement a naming strategy for the tables to help group the tables nicely:

* **DashboardStrings** Contains locale specific text.  
* **DashboardAssets** Contains locale specific assets.
